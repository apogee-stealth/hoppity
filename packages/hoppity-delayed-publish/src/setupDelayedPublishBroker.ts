/**
 * Sets up delayed publish functionality on a broker instance
 * This function extends the broker with delayedPublish method and sets up subscriptions
 *
 * This follows Hoppity's extension pattern where middleware functions
 * extend the broker with additional capabilities. Unlike Rascal's direct broker usage,
 * Hoppity uses a builder pattern with middleware that can add methods to the broker.
 *
 * RABBITMQ TTL MECHANICS: This implementation uses RabbitMQ's TTL (Time-To-Live) feature
 * with dead letter exchanges to achieve delayed publishing:
 * 1. Messages are published to a wait queue with TTL set to the desired delay
 * 2. When TTL expires, RabbitMQ automatically moves messages to a ready queue via dead letter exchange
 * 3. A subscription processes the ready queue and re-publishes to the original destination
 *
 * @param broker - The broker instance to extend (Hoppity's BrokerAsPromised wrapper)
 * @param options - Delayed publish configuration options
 * @param logger - Optional logger instance for delayed publish operations
 * @returns Promise that resolves when setup is complete
