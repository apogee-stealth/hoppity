 * 1. Start with an initial topology configuration
 * 2. Apply middleware functions that can modify the topology
 * 3. Create the broker with the final topology
 * 4. Execute post-creation callbacks from middleware (broker instance is passed to the callback)
 *
 * The pipeline ensures that topology modifications happen before broker creation,
 * and callbacks execute after the broker is available, enabling complex setup scenarios.
